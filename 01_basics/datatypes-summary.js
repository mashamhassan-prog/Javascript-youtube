//Summary on Datatypes as per interview perspective!

// Datatypes are divided into two parts:
// 1: Primitive ; 2: Non-Primitive or (Reference Type)

// how they both differ;
// like how data will transfer into the memory? or how it is access?
// by these two basis of data the PRIMITIVE and NON-PRIMITIVE datatypes are categorized!

// There are 7 basic types of Primitive Datatypes:
// 1: String
// 2: Number
// 3: Boolean (yes/no ; true/false)
// 4: Null (null means empty (not a 0 or not an empty string) )
// 5: undefined (in which we dont know what the value returns)
// 6: Symbol (symbol is used to make any value unique)
// 7: BigInt (it is used for scientific values or for some very higher values whcih cannot handle then we can use SYMBOL)


// There are now few more types of Reference Type (Non-Primitive) datatype:
// 1: Array
// 2: Objects (if you want to master JS so you must have to master JavaScript's Objects)
// 3: Functions


// There's one more thing which is asked many times:
// Is Javascript Dynamically Type Language or Statically Type Language??
